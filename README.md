**Different Applications of machine learning across various domains**

MACHINE LEARNING IS THE USE AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS THAT ARE ABLE TO LEARN AND ADAPT WITHOUT FOLLOWING EXPLICIT INSTRUCTION.

There are many applications and uses of machine learning that some of us are blind to see because it is hiding in plain sight. Everything that uses AI is using machine learning and here are some examples of application that uses machine learning:


**Language translation**

The process of converting the written word from one language into another language in a away that is culturally and linguistically appreciate so it can be understood by its intended audience.

The art and science of translating text or spoken words from one language into another while maintaining their original meaning, intent, and tone.

Language translation allows people to understand one another in without changing your native language and by translating it over into the target language.

Language translation uses supervised learning because, to produce a given outcome, it takes some given inputs and perform one or more layers of mathematical transformation based on adjusting data weightings.

Such as statistical machine translation (SMT) and neural machine translation (nmt), relies on parallel data to learn the relationship between the source and target audience.

Language translation is integral in connecting people, business and cultures and making communication across linguistic barriers possible.


**Facial Recognition**

In face recognition process, the input image is compared with the dataset. The input image is also called as probe and the dataset is called as gallery.

This system is used to identify people in photos, videos, or in real-time. It is a category of biometric security.

In sensitive location like banks and airports, facial recognition is used as a preventive security to identify criminals or any potential threats. 

This system uses supervised learning as it is efficient and accurate, it also significantly improve with the use of supervised learning that classify image based on individual’s identity.

The facial recognition creates a data protection and cybersecurity, it also offers facial authentication that determine if the face in two images belong to the same person.


**chatbots**

chatbots automate workflows and free up employee from repetitive tasks.

A chatbot can eliminate long wait times for phones-based customer supports, or even longer wait times for email, chat and web-based support.

In sensitive location like banks and airports, facial recognition is used as a preventive security to identify criminals or any potential threats.

Chatbots system uses both supervised and unsupervised machine learning because sometimes chatbots rely to client in order to learn and sometime chatbots are self-taught.

The chatbots can reduce misinformation by providing credible and reliable sources of information and they can be trained to be more accurate and recognize falsehood.


**Different Applications of machine learning across various domains**

According to many research, ai is an extension of human brain, that’s why there are supervised machine learning and the unsupervised are self-taught that ai must learn in order to evolve it self to its fullest.

There are many types of application and domains that uses  machine learning and still counting, some are helpful and some are use for laziness but all of it are created by human and it shows how human evolve.
